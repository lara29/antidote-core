Syringe is part of the [Antidote](https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote) project, which provides an in-browser infrastructure automation learning platform. Syringe's role is to provide all of the back-end orchestration to make this possible. It provides a layer of middleware between the `antidote-web` front-end, and the Kubernetes cluster where all of Antidote's lesson entities are running.
