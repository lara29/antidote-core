This repository is where the core services of the Antidote project are maintained. This includes `antidoted`, which is the primary service for provisioning curriculum content within a Kubernetes infrastructure.

If you're looking for the web front-end for Antidote, that code is maintained in a separate repository: [`antidote-web`](https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote-web).

The [Antidote documentation](https://docs.nrelabs.io/antidote/antidote-architecture) contains additional architectural details as well as first steps for hacking on Antidote.
